Hi Fernanda!
Many thanks for contacting me with this opportunity.
Unfortunately I'm not an iOS developer :/
And even if I have some experience with react I consider myself 90% backend dev.

I specialize in python, though I also know how to use JavaScript (with nodejs), C#, Ruby, and others.

Please, let me know if you get an opportunity that might be a better fit for me

Thank you! üòÅ
