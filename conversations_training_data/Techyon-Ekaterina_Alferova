Dear Ing. Alvaro,

My name is Ekaterina, I'm a Recruitment Manager at Techyon (IT headhunting).
Currently I am looking for a Sr Software Engineer (Python, Django) for a tech start up based in California that's working in a hotellerie industry (with focus on Revenue Management).

You may find a complete JD here:

If you're interested, it'd be great to schedule a call via google meet to dive into the details.

Thanks,

Hi Ekaterina!
Many thanks for contacting me and for the offer.

This opportunity seems great!
Unfortunately i don't currently have any exp with ETL nor Machine learning, but I do have 3 years of exp with Django and 5 with Python and would love to lear ML and ETL. I'd even ask for less than usual compensation for the opportunity to learn those.

What do you think of this?

Hi Ekaterina!
Sure, this is my email: alvaroscelza@gmail.com
I'm free of meetings all day tomorrow, I'm currently at GMT-3 (it's currently 16:22 here).

Though I'm planning on moving to Europe so that shouldn't be a problem in the future.
