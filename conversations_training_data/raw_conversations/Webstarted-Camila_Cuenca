Hello Camila! How are you?

I saw your post for various developer jobs and wondered if you might have something that would be a good fit for what I'm looking for.

I am currently looking for a job with a company that has its own product, and I ideally would like to work with Python.

In addition, I would love to learn Artificial Intelligence and I am willing to earn much less than usual for a job that gives me the opportunity to learn that.

Do you have or will you have in the future something that fits that?

I am from Uruguay.

At the moment, I don't think I have positions that match your preferences, I apologize. But we have new searches every week, so I offer to keep in touch so I can approach you with future proposals that may interest you! ðŸ¤—
