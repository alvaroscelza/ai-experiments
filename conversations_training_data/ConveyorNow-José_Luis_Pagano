Hi José!

Thank you for contacting me and considering me for this opportunity.

I would like to ask you a few questions in order to better understand the job conditions:
1- Is it necessary to use the client's equipment or can I use my own?
2- What technologies are used in this position?
3- Does this company have its own products or does it provide staff augmentation/software factory services instead?
4- Does this position offer the opportunity to get involved in AI?
