Hello Paula!
Thank you for reaching out to me and offering this opportunity.

For a non-100% remote job with .Net, I would request a minimum of 6800 USD per month, although depending on the type of project it could be less. Does this fit within the budget you have planned for the position?

Best regards,

remote: False
