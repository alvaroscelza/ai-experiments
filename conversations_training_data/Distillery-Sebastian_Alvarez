Hi Sebastian! I saw your Full Stack React/Python ad in the jobs channel and I'm interested, could you tell me more please?

Message:
Sure Alvaro,
We are looking for a SR React+Python - approximately 5 years of experience + conversational English.
It would be for working on a USA project as a long term arrangement, not a seasonal or project-based contract, it's an indefinite time arrangement.
In addition, we are talking about a contractor relationship with PTOs, paid vacations, equipment provided by the company among other things. 100% remote work.
Would you leave your CV for me to evaluate the potential fit with the proposal? üòä
